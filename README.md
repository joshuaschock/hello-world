hello-world
===========

This is my first repository while learning GitHub. This is more advanced writing so people can understand my project better. I am resolving my first created issue (problem with my project)... (duh!). 

I think I jumped the gun a bit, so to speak, on editing this README without creating a new branch. OOPS! I think I got the hang of it now. This is my second edit under my new branch of README-edits. I am new to coding and trying to learn SWIFT, javascript, and Objective C. Looking to develop iOS apps, possibly. I should make sure the market isn't over saturated since I am trying to make money. haha.

I need a third edit now so I can add the comment in the commit. oops again. I should read more instructions. just a tad bit confusing.
